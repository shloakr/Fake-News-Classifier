The test size was 25% and the accuracy was 96.43%. Additionally, the K fold accuracy was 96.28% when cv=5. To test the model further, testing was done with a different dataset. Using this dataset, the accuracy was 76.43%. Limitations: The datasets used were from 2016-2018 based on US politics hence the model works best with US political articles. See the code on github.
